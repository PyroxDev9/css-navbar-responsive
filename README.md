# css-navbar-responsive
Inspired by Fireship.io, I've decided to clone his project on building a responsive navbar that is located on the left side of the user's screen (if on Desktop). However, on smaller devices, it shifts to the bottom of the screen. ALL credits go to Fireship.io for this project.

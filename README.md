# css-navbar-responsive
Inspired by Fireship.io, I've decided to clone his project on building a responsive navbar that is located on the left side of the user's screen (if on Desktop). However, on smaller devices, it shifts to the bottom of the screen. **ALL credits go to Fireship.io for this project.**

**Note:** If you decide to use `theme.js` to change the theme of your sidebar, add the script source link AFTER the </html> tag, or else it will throw an error.
